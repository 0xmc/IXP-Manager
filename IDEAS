Potential Todo / Feature Ideas
------------------------------

* Add support for INEX member private VLAN service:

Existing schema.  Private vlans should be defined in the vlan table.  The
vlan table needs an extra field called "private", maybe.  Need a separate
privatevlan table to link up vlaninterface ids to these vlans + a little
front-end glue to show what private VLANs are defined and who they are
associated with.

Finally, this all needs to be checked to make sure it works with the sflow
stuff, including that the specific private vlan member owners can see the
vlan, but no-one else can.



* Put a frontend on the new RIB database table(s)

* INEX require that members peer "with at least the greater of 4 other
  Members, or 10% of other Members". A tool to list members failing this
  requirement would be useful.

* Email members on >80% of port utilisation

* Show who a member peers with (or not) on the overview page

* Show if a member is on the route server or not

* Member audit - port states, errors / discards, route collector session
  status, route server session status, etc.


* Go through application/config/application.ini.dist and fix FIXMEs and add new
  documentation where indicated
