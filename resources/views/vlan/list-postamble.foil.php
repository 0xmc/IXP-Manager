    <h3>VLANs</h3>

    <p>
        You can use this page to manage your VLANs. There are typically two types of VLANs at an IXP: the public peering LAN(s) and,
        where the service is offered, private VLANs between subsets of members (usually just two).

    <p>
        VLANs belong to <a href="<?= route('infrastructure@list' ) ?>">infrastructures</a> and a unique key constrant exists between
        an infrastructure and the VLAN's 802.1q tag.
