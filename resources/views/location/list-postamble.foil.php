                Facilities in IXP Manager are data centres / points of presence. A facility is somewhere that contains your racks. Racks in turn contain switches.
            </p>
            <em>In previous versions of IXP Manager, facilities were referred to as locations and the backend schema still uses this older terminology.</em>
