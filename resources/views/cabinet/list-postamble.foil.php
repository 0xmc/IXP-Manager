            <p>
                Racks in IXP Manager exist in your facilities (data centres / points of presence / locations). A rack contains your switches, patch panels, etc.
            </p>

            <em>In previous versions of IXP Manager, racks were referred to as cabinets and the backend schema still uses this older terminology.</em>
