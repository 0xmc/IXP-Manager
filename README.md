## About IXP Manager

For detailed information, see: https://www.ixpmanager.org/

IXP Manager is a full stack management system for Internet eXchange 
Points (IXPs) which includes an administration and customer portal; 
provides end to end provisioning; and both teaches and implements 
best practice.

It allows IXPs to manage new customers, provision new connections / 
services and monitor traffic usage. It has a number of provisioning 
templates including its ability to generate secure proven route 
server configuration and provides a built in looking glass for these.

[INEX](https://www.inex.ie/) is an Internet eXchange Point and Ireland's IP 
peering hub. It is a neutral, industry-owned Association, founded in 1996, 
that provides IP peering facilities for its members. INEX membership is open 
to all organisations that can benefit from peering their IP traffic.
